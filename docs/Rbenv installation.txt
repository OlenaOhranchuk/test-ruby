1. Install rbenv and ruby-build:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install rbenv ruby-build

2. Initialize rbenv when terminal starts:
	rbenv init

3. The previous command should output something like this:
	# Load rbenv automatically by appending
	# the following to ~/.bashrc:

	eval "$(rbenv init -)"

4. You need to copy the last line (eval...) and past it at the end of your .bashrc file.

5. Reopen your terminal. Now rbenv should be installed.

If you need to get latest versions of ruby you should install ruby-build as a plugin:
	mkdir -p "$(rbenv root)"/plugins
	git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build
